# Our process
We started out doing this piece by piece with querySelectors first, then Event Listeners, and then functions.

## What we could've done differently
We could've written out each feature aspect instead of grouping our progress by like items. We found it useful, however to have all of our querySelectors and event listeners ready for us.

We think our naming conventions could've been better, more clear and distinctive.

# Our Growth
- We, Ian and Cole, learned a lot about how convenient it is to have a project partner with the same schedule as we could imagine how hard it could be if hadn't.
- We realized the value of driver navigator as we could brainstorm together.
- We also found solutions on our own and brought them to the partner for diagnostics which was a good taste of working async.
- We realized we work super well because, we are both on the more humble side so we felt very comfortable trying each other's ideas and both put a lot into the project.
